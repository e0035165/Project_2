1) Generate_phased_output

Generate phase voltage Vun and space vector for a period of 0.3s
Sampling time:1MHz

2) STATE

At each instantaneous time based on carrier frequency,

At each carrier freq time period, we check the state of where the vector is.

(Note: Do not confuse sampling time with frequency. Sampling freq is much larger than carrier frequency)

3) switch_states

Determine the on-off states for each inverter in the 3 phase inverter, based on which sector the SVM is in, the switching states will be called.

4) State_vector

It is to get the left vector and right vector voltage within the sector (Complex value)

5) plot_phasors

At each sampling period, the value of Vun is plotted in a 1-D array and time axis is also appended in a 1-D array accordingly.

Vun is Y-axis

T is x-axis with 1microsecond division


6) plotSpectrum (FFT)

7) plotSpectrum (FFT zoom)

8) time_move

tr, tl and tz respectively for each vector and angle readjustment will be done automatically within the function

9) Main function where you input the fundamental frequency, Vin, modulation index and starting angle.
Adjustment will be done accordingly.
